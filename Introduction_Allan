Hello, I am Allan and I'm part of the Azubi Africa Cloud Engineering Program. I'm from a Marketing background and have worked as a Contact Centre Manager, A quality analyst and finally as Customer Service Trainer. I'm branching out in to tech. As it is never too late to find a new passion.

I'm interested in tech, in particular Kubernetes and containerization.

My favourite team is Tottenham Hotspur

My ideal superpower would be the same as Omni Man and i'd like to be invulnerable so I can live for a very long time and age very slowly.
