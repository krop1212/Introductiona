My name is Naomi Kamweru. My background is in IT and currently an Applications Analyst.
I love working out, reading and trying out new places.
My expectations from the course is to be able to be a certified cloud practioner to be able to change my career.
Fun fact about me is I can always find sleep even in the middle of chaos.
I wish I'd be able to read minds.
