I'm Uthman Adewuyi, and I'm enrolled in the cloud engineering programme at Azubi Africa.
I've developed software utilising the DotNet Framework. 
My goal in taking this course is to become extremely skilled in order to obtain a well-paying career. Fun fact: I adore my tribe. 
Being Superman is the superpower I'd most like to have.
